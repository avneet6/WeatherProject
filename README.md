# PROJECT DESCRIPTION #

1. API Key Registration:
    Sign up at OpenWeatherMap and get an API key.
   
2. Setting up the Project:
   Create a new project folder.
   Initialize a new Node.js project using "npm init" for building a server-side application.
   Install necessary dependencies, such as body parser for parsing request bodies.
   Install express.js. 

3. Creating the Front-End in that project folder:
   Create a file name that is index.html. In that i made one form in which i created a label to put cityname and i created button. And i write all the css code in it.

4. Now i explain you how codes are work:
   When i installed the dependencies and express.js then node_modules, package.json and package-lock.json also installed. 
   I created a file that name is "app.js" in WeatherProject.
   I require express, HTTP and Body Parser.
   I use body parser to parse URL-encoded bodies.
   Then handle GET request to the root URL.
   Send the "index.html" file to the client.
   Get the city name from the request response function.
   Now need API Key, for that i opened "OpenWeatherMap API" in browser and get the API key from it then need url of "OpenWeatherMAP API" .
   Make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
   Then i use a log response status code.
   Parse the JSON Data.
   Then extract the temperature, weather description and weather icon code.
   Set the response content type to HTML with UTF-8 encoding.
   Write the temperature,description and icon image to the response.
   Then Start the server on port 4000.
   For run the code, you need to run "node app.js".
   then open any browser and type "localhost:4000".
   
6. Conclusion:
   I built a weather application project. In that i made a simple UI page. when you run the application then you need to fill "city name". So, when you write any city 
   name and click on "Go" button then you get the temperature, description and weather icon image of that city. You can also you it on daily basis and time to time it 
   will changes when you refresh it. I will built through OpenWeatherMap website.
